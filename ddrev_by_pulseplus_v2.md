1. How will the user input their music genres? We recommend using a checkbox so it limits user input and you can have search terms to use for spotify.
2. What datatype for SQL are you going to be using to store arrays?
3. Will you add cookies so that if a logged-in user closes the page and reopens it, they are still logged in?
4. Did your team discuss adding a searchbar in home.html? What would happen if the user wants a specific song/articles/tweets?
5. Thoughts on using JS? Would come in handy in the home page and displaying suggestions.
6. This design doc is well written and only missing a bit of the small details.
